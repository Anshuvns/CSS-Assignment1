    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    <ul type="disc">
        
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however, <mark>in this tutitorial we
            will use inline and internal styles</mark>, because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it
            yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the
        other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link
        directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
    </p>
    <h6>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has
        been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</h6>
    <h5>There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied</h5>
